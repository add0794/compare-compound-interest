# compare-compound-interest

Would you like to automate how you calculate compound interest? Sometimes, Excel is not enough, or if it is, it can be tedious. 

This Python program makes the process quick and efficient, requiring you to answer only a few questions and answering your questions within **miliseconds**. 

You'll get compound interest values at different rates, principals, and number of times the interest is compounded per year. 

Create a virtual environment in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), then install the program's dependencies (i.e. matplotlib and numpy). You'll be prompted to answer a few questions (e.g. 's the lowest interest rate you'd accept), and you'll get a graph comparing how the interest grows at different rates, in addition to those arrays.

Feel free to give feedback after you've tried the program!
